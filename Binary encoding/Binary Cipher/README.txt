This program will convert from text to binary and back again. It feeds from Input.txt and outputs to Output.dat. 
To convert files, simply paste them into the Input.txt
When converting to binary, you will have the option to encrypt using a XOR cipher. The keyfile you enter will be stored in Cipher_file.dat so that you can remember it.
When reading an encrypted binary file, you will be prompted to enter the key to decode it. 
When converting normal binary, there is no key involved.
If you can break the cipher I have placed on the sample input, consider yourself amazing. 

This took me way too long to code... fricking modular arithmetic ciphers ain't easy.
In case you are wondering, I built the binary encoder by hand without any help from the web.
